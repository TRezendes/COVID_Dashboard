# COVID_Dashboard

A dashboard to track COVID-19 related data in Pennsylvania in general and Lancaster County specifically.

## Origins

This project started back in May of 2021. COVID-19 had been with us for a year, and I was curious if Memorial Day and Independence Day were going to spark a surge in cases.
At the time, I was eight or nine months into a 20 month Masters in Data Science program. Building this dashboard was a way for me to help manage my anxiety about the pandemic *and* work on my [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) skills.

## Current State

My masters program moved on from R, and I was spending a lot more time in Python. This project started to languish.

The world moved on from caring about the COVID pandemic, even though it never moved on from killing us. I have meds to help manage my anxiety now; they also mitigate my need to obsessively watch these numbers go up and down. I still check in with the project every now and then. I [just updated it](https://github.com/TRezendes/COVID_Dashboard/commit/4e33564e89b0d222ecad32f4687baccc6c597121) on 3/6/2023 to add 2023 numbers.

## Concerns

Of course, feel free to play with what I have here, not that it is in anyway intelligible to anyone but (and even barely) me. Also, I'd love it if anyone cares enough and knows enough to let me know if I've done anything egregiously wrong here. I like R a lot, but I am very much a newbie. For instance, I am extremely intrigued by how closely the Pennsylvania state data and the Lancaster County data coincide, the latter a microcosm of the former. Except, it makes me worry that I've done something boneheaded and mixed up the data in some way. Also, I struggled for a long time trying to plot year over year data cleanly. I finally got it to work by treating all the data as though it is from the same year, merely adding days to past years to bring the dates in line with the current year. It seems like there must be a better way to do this, but I haven't found one. If anyone knows how to do it, I would *love* it if you could share.

## Future

I don't imagine anyone cares about this except me. I would someday like to clean it up into an actual, functional, online dashboard of Pennsylvania COVID-19 data. I sort of hope that by the time I get around to doing that, It will be utterly irrelevant. I fear that it never will be. In the meantime, there are certainly better, professional dashboards and sources from which to get this data. That said, since I began this project, I finished my master's program and got a new job. I am finding places in that job where R may be a help to me, and since I haven't touched it much in the last couple of years, I need to brush up my skills. With any luck, you'll see this project get some attention in the coming months as I use it to try to get my R legs back under me (that metaphor would work better with C). With the advent of [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), I would also like to move the project over from original R Markdown so that I can get some experience with this new format.

## Miscellany

This section is really just a place to plug the book [Learning Statistics with R](https://github.com/djnavarro/rbook), by [Danielle Navarro](https://github.com/djnavarro). Why mention it? It doesn't actually have anything specific to do with this project. It is, however, the reason I understand R (and statistics, for that matter) at all. I struggled mightily with that class in my degree program, and this book got me through. I suspect anyone who gives a rip about R knows the book, but if you don't, give it a look. It's absolutely worth your time.
